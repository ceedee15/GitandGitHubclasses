  <p>We use Git for 2 things. 1. To track the history. For eg, if we are trying to create a website, we are adding features for website one after the other. First we will add the sign up page, then add buttons, then add help form. While adding this help form feature takes time, so you decided to work on this feature then add later and you want the website to be as before. So we have to sit and delete the code line by line manually. It is risky to delete manually. We need a automatic software and we also should know how much lines of codes have written for the website till the buttons got added. We should have that history. So Git helps in tracking that history for the coding of a website.
    2. To collaborate – Think you work as a team in your job, all the developers or team members work on one project. It is important to track the features added in the project or what all changes happened in the project by whom. Also, the changes should not be overridden by others. So Git helps to resolve this problem and in collaborating.
