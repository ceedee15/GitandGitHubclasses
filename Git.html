  <h1>Git</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>It is Version control system. If you are doing a project you do it in a version control system. What file created, what file deleted, what are added and deleted and changed in the files are through Git.
  Not only projects, lot of companies uses Git and Git Hub. 
  Free and open source
  Fast and scalable – used in small scale as well as big scale projects
  </p>
  <p>We use Git for 2 things. 1. To track the history. For eg, if we are trying to create a website, we are adding features for website one after the other. First we will add the sign up page, then add buttons, then add help form. While adding this help form feature takes time, so you decided to work on this feature then add later and you want the website to be as before. So we have to sit and delete the code line by line manually. It is risky to delete manually. We need a automatic software and we also should know how much lines of codes have written for the website till the buttons got added. We should have that history. So Git helps in tracking that history for the coding of a website.
    2. To collaborate – Think you work as a team in your job, all the developers or team members work on one project. It is important to track the features added in the project or what all changes happened in the project by whom. Also, the changes should not be overridden by others. So Git helps to resolve this problem and in collaborating.

    <h2> GitHub</h2>
    <p>Git is a toll that runs in our PC. GitHub is a website. Developers can upload their changes, do changes in the code, if we do any changes in our system, that change can reflect in the GitHub website. We upload the projects in folder form and we call that folder as repository.  In short we call it as repos. </p>
    <h2>Steps to Follow:</h2>
    <p>1. Download Git bash, 2. Create GitHub Account, 3. Download VS Code</p>
