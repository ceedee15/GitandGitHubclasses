  <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>

<h2>Git</h2>
<p>It is Version control system. If you are doing a project you do it in a version control system. What file created, what file deleted, what are added and deleted and changed in the files are through Git.
  Not only projects, lot of companies uses Git and Git Hub. 
  Free and open source
  Fast and scalable – used in small scale as well as big scale projects
  </p>
  <p>We use Git and GitHub for 2 things. <ul>1. To track the history. For eg, if we are trying to create a website, we are adding features for website one after the other. First we will add the sign up page, then add buttons, then add help form. While adding this help form feature takes time, so you decided to work on this feature then add later and you want the website to be as before. So we have to sit and delete the code line by line manually. It is risky to delete manually. We need a automatic software and we also should know how much lines of codes have written for the website till the buttons got added. We should have that history. So Git helps in tracking that history for the coding of a website.</ul>
    <ul>2. To collaborate – Think you work as a team in your job, all the developers or team members work on one project. It is important to track the features added in the project or what all changes happened in the project by whom. Also, the changes should not be overridden by others. So Git helps to resolve this problem and in collaborating.</ul>
    </p>
    <h2> GitHub</h2>
    <p>Git is a toll that runs in our PC. GitHub is a website. Developers can upload their changes, do changes in the code at Git. If we do any changes in our system, that change can reflect in the GitHub website. We upload the projects in folder form and we call that folder as repository.  In short we call it as repos. </p>
    <h2>Tools Required:</h2>
    <ul>1. Download <b>Git bash</b>,</ul><ul>2. Create <b>GitHub Account</b>,</ul><ul>3. Download <b>VS Code</b></ul>
    <h2>Commands</h2>
      <ul>The following commands are used commonly in Git.</ul>
      <ul>1. <i>git clone (http:) </i>- To clone the repository from GitHub to Git.</ul>
      <ul>2. <i>git add</i> - This command is used to add the changes made in the file.</ul>
     <ul>3.  <i>git add . </i>- This command is used to add the overall changes in the reposiory.</ul>
      <ul>4. <i>git commit -m "your commit message"</i> - this command is used when you add the change and to make it visible in the repository.</ul>
      <ul>5. <i>git push origin (any branch) </i>- To push the changes from the git to GitHub.</ul>
      <ul>6. <i>git pull </i>- to pull the changes.</ul>
      <ul>7. <i>git checkout (branch) </i>- To go that particular branch in the repository.</ul>
      <ul>8. <i>cd (repository) </i>- To go to that particular repository or location or folder.</ul>
      <ul>9. <i>git merge (branch)</i> - To merge the branches in the repository.</ul>
      <ul>10. <i>ls </i>- Lists out the files in the repository.</ul>
      <ul>11. <i>git config --global user.name </i>- To add the username for git.</ul>
      <ul>12. <i>git config --global user.email </i>- To add the email.</ul>
      <ul>13. <i>clear </i>- To clear the commands from the terminal.</ul>
      <ul>14. <i>git status </i>- To show the status of repository. If any changes made in Git and not commited, it will reflect in the status.</ul>
      <ul>15. <i>git add (file name) </i>- To add changes made in a particular file.</ul>
      <ul>16. <i>git init </i>- To initialise the folder created.</ul>
      <ul>17. <i>cd .. </i>- to move back from a repository.</ul>
      <h2>Steps to follow:</h2>
      <ul>1. Create a new repository in GitHub - GitandGitHubClasses.</ul>
      <ul>2. Created new file - Git.html</ul> 
      <ul>3. Created 2 branches from main branch - AT and Sophonie</ul>
      <ul>4. Go to VS code and give git clone (http address)</ul>
      <ul>5. cd GitandGitHubClasses (go to that repository)</ul>
      <ul>6. git branch -a (to know what all branches added in the repo)</ul>
      <ul>7. git checkout AT (to go AT branch)</ul>
      <ul>8. Add some infos in the created Git.html file</ul>
      <ul>9. git add . (to add the changes in the repo)</ul>
      <ul>10. git status (to check the status of the modified file)</ul>
      <ul>11. git commit -m "added paragraphs" (to commit the changes in the file)</ul>
      <ul>12. git push origin AT (to make the changes visible in the GitHub)</ul>
      <ul>13. git checkout main (to go to main branch)</ul>
      <ul>14. git merge AT (merge AT branch with main branch)</ul>
      <ul>15. git push origin main (to make the changes in the AT branch appear in main branch)</ul>
      <ul>16. git checkout sophonie (to go to Sophonie branch)</ul>
      <ul>17. git pull origin main (to pull the changes from the main branch to sophonie branch)</ul>
      <ul>18. Add some more paragraph in the HTML file</ul>
      <ul>19. Git add . (add the changes)</ul>
      <ul>20. Git commit -m “added git description” ( to commit the changes)</ul>
      <ul>21. Git push origin Sophonie ( to make the changes appear in the GitHub page)</ul>
      <ul>22. Git checkout main (go to main branch)</ul>
      <ul>23. Git merge Sophonie (merge Sophonie branch with main branch)</ul>
      <ul>24. Git push origin main ( to make all the changes in the Sophonie branch to appear in the main branch)</ul>

      <p> These are the steps to follow to create a new repository for a project, create branches with the team members name, make changes in the code and merge it with the main branch</p>
